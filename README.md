# React-Order-Meal-Website

"This project encompasses a food ordering website developed using React. I rewrote the project from scratch as an effort to learn and apply React, building upon a previously followed educational series. Currently , it has the functionality to dynamically add desired food items to the cart by fetching data from the firebase. Additionally, users can perform actions such as adding or removing items from the cart by clicking on it. During the order process, the user information form includes a validation mechanism to verify the accuracy of the provided information. Additionally, the 'Order' command is emulated by sending a 'POST' request through Firebase.

The project was developed using essential React concepts such as useContext, useEffect, and useState hooks. Furthermore, I learned how to establish a proper component structure and folder organization to make the project more organized and sustainable.

In the project, I also acquired the skill of positioning components like modals in the HTML file using React.createPortal to place them where needed."
